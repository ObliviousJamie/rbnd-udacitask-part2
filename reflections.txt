# REFLECTIONS
# -------------------------------------------------------
1. How long did you spend working on this project?
Roughly 2:30 hours
2. What was the most rewarding challenge you conquered?
Using the HighLine gem
3. What two additional features did you build? Why?
    Feature 1) Allowing users to delete multiple items, I chosed this as I haven't worked with splat operation very often and wanted to try them.
    Feature 2/3) I used gems the way I did to a) try improve my app visually and b) improve user interaction. The additon of being able to change priority and dates was a mundane task but I felt it was a core part of using the app.
4. Where do you still have room to grow?
Knowing when to use modules and exactly how to use them.
